Welcome to the documentation for mlcomm!
=========================================

The next-generation telecommunications in Beyond 5G, 6G, and Internet of Things (IoT) concepts require reliabilty and low-latency to fuel the increasing requirement for fast and available data.  Leveraging practices in Machine Learning to enhance and modify existing features in the current standards enable these future capabilities.
