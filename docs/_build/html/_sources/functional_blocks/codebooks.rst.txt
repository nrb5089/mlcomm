mlcomm.codebooks
=================

Features codebook construction for both Binary Hierarchical codebook, shown in Figure below,

In addition, we feature construction of a Trinary Hierarhical codebook in which each narrow beam has a corresponding broad beam steered in the same direction.  Conversely, the broader beams split into three non-overlapping beams as well.  Example shown below.
